# NYC public pool closures

This project visualizes data about NYC's public pool closures from 2023-2024.  After seeing this [Gothamist article](https://gothamist.com/news/these-nyc-pools-kept-closing-last-summer-after-people-pooped-in-them) which maps the total number of hours each pool was closed for cleaning after poop incidents, I wanted to find out more, especially since the pool I go to the most was a giant brown dot on the map.
