# NYC public pool closures

This project visualizes data about NYC's public pool closures in the summer of 2024.  It was inspired by this [Gothamist article](https://gothamist.com/news/these-nyc-pools-kept-closing-last-summer-after-people-pooped-in-them) which maps the total number of hours each pool was closed for cleaning after level 1 and level 2 incidents.  

One thing stood out to me immediately: larger pools were closed for more hours, but pool size and visitor numbers were not included in their analysis.  Having been to a few pools around the city I knew there was data on attendance and capacity.  I've seen pool employees with handheld clickers counting visitors and I was once shocked to see a sign outside of the Red Hook Pool stating a maximum capacity of 1,716 people.  I've never seen it that full, but have seen smaller pools with swimmers lined up outside when they've reached capacity.  So, what else can the city's open data tell us about pools?
